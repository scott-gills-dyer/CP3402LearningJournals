## Content Insights
This week, I reviewed my previous web design practicals to refresh my understanding of HTML, particularly page structure and the use of elements such as div and class attributes. I also learned how to publish a website using GitHub Pages and explored how to incorporate Bootstrap into my practical work.

Although I was able to complete the practical tasks, I am not fully confident yet and expect that I will still need to refer back to earlier materials while continuing to build my skills. I can see how Bootstrap significantly reduces the time required to build a website from scratch by providing ready-made components and layout structures that can be customised to suit the needs of a developer or client.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights
From a career and employability perspective, learning how to use Bootstrap and GitHub Pages is valuable because these tools are commonly used in modern web development. Being able to publish websites using GitHub Pages demonstrates that I can use this platform to showcase project work or create client demonstration sites in the future.

While front-end web development is not currently my primary career focus, the skills I practised this week are still useful in IT roles, particularly when supporting web-based systems, internal tools, and basic website maintenance.
