## Content Insights
This week I spent time reading the WordPress documentation and learning the interface. It is similar to Joomla, but I found WordPress more logical as pages are edited directly instead of creating separate articles and assigning them. Most of my time was spent locating settings through documentation and Google, which helped me better understand how WordPress structures themes, pages, and plugins. I found the overall implementation easier than Joomla due to the simpler admin layout. I also used ChatGPT to learn how to correctly implement Bootstrap within WordPress on InfinityFree hosting.


## Career / Employability / Learning Insights
There is a large amount of content available for WordPress. I can see why WordPress is widely used in industry, its lower entry barrier allows more businesses to manage their own sites. This creates opportunities for IT support roles, as many businesses may need technical assistance or CSS rather than hire a web developer.
