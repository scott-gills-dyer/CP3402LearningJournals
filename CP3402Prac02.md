## Content Insights
This week I spent time learning how Joomla works as a CMS and how to create and manage content through its administrator interface.
I found the CloudAccess tutorial videos particularly helpful because they showed the full setup process. Compared to building a site purely with HTML and CSS, using templates made it much faster to launch a my website.
I also spent less time troubleshooting HTML and layout issues, as the Joomla template handled most of the structure and styling for me. 
I am not a fan on Joomla's interface and default options which cause some minor annoyances.


## Career / Employability / Learning Insights
I can see why content management systems are widely used in the web and IT industry. Being able to quickly update content, 
publish new pages and change layouts without manually editing source files saves a significant amount of development and maintenance time. The documentation and video tutorials were helpful, however some of the videos were based on an older version of Joomla, which caused small differences in the interface and options. This showed me that in real-world situations my ability to work with a new CMS will depend on how quickly I can read and understand documentation and adapt to changes between versions.
